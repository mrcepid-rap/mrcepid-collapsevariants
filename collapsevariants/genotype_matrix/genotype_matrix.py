    Convert BGEN genotypes into a sparse matrix format.

    Creates a CSR matrix from BGEN file genotypes for use in STAAR/GLM association testing.
    The matrix represents samples as rows and either genes or variants as columns.
    Non-alternate genotypes are filtered out during conversion.

    Note that in order to optimise this process we are collapsing the variants here (stored in the CSR matrix part
    of our output tuple). We are also saving gene and sample level variant information in a dictionary,
    so that this information can be used downstream (for example, when generating the log file).
    There is also a functionality where if should_collapse_matrix is set to False, then we append the entire variant
    matrix in a CSR format. This is used in the associationtesting modules downstream. The rationale for doing it this
    way is that we can save memory when collapsing, but still be able to call the un-collapsed matrices when needed.

    :param variant_list: DataFrame containing variants to extract.
    :param bgen_path: Path to the BGEN file.
    :param sample_path: Path to the sample file.
    :param should_collapse_matrix: If True (default) collapse variants - sum variants per gene.
        If False, don't sum variants per gene and return the matrix instead.
    :return: A tuple containing:
        - csr_matrix: A sparse matrix with shape (n_samples, n_genes_or_variants).
        - summary_dict: A dictionary with summary information for each gene.
