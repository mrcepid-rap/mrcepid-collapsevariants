    """An Interface for creating files for burden testing.

    This Interface implements the general functionality for creating files for burden testing for all possible
    tools that are implemented downstream in this pipeline. Generally speaking it:

    1. Requests input of variant lists (:param genes:) and genotype indices (:param genotype_index:) for each BGEN file.
    Note that the genotype indices are not necessarily used by every implementing class.

    2. It sets an output list for holding various outputs of implementing classes.

    3. It uses ThreadUtility to parallelize the creation of files for burden testing using the abstract method
    :func:`_make_output_files`. It is required by implementing classes to define this method to create files that
    are specific to the tool they are implementing.

    This means that the implementing classes DO NOT need to worry about parallelizing the creation of files. This is
    automatically handled by the ToolParser class automatically parallelizing the :func:`_make_output_files` abstract
    method.

    :param genes: A dictionary containing the genes to collapse with keys of the BGEN file prefixes and values of
    :param genotype_index: A dictionary containing values of csr_matrix and keys of each BGEN file prefix.
    :param sample_ids: A list of sample IDs for processing this file.
    :param output_prefix: A string representing the prefix of the output files.
    :param tool_name: A string representing the name of the tool of the implementing class.
